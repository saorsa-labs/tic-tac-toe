/**
 * Per-pubkey localStorage record store for channels manually marked unread via
 * right-click → "mark unread". Keyed by channelId (not thread-root). Persisted
 * so the sidebar badge survives reload and the rail observer can read it for
 * inactive communities.
 *
 * Each entry stores the channel's own NIP-RS read marker (unix seconds) at the
 * moment mark-unread was invoked, or null if no marker existed yet. The rail
 * observer gates the forced-unread OR on this baseline: if the observed synced
 * read marker has since advanced past markerAtWhenForced, the cross-device read
 * wins and the dot is not lit.
 *
 * On identity change, the in-memory map is swapped to the current pubkey's
 * persisted data. Old pubkey data is NOT wiped from localStorage.
 *
 * NOT synced to the relay — NIP-RS markers are monotonic and cannot represent
 * a retrograde "unread" state. localStorage is best-effort (per-device).
