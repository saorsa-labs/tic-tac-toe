/**
 * Small observable for `ConnectionState`. Kept separate from the relay client
 * so the file-size budget stays sane and so the contract is unit-testable
 * without dragging the whole session manager into scope.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *  - `set(next)` is a no-op if `next === current` (no duplicate events).
 *  - New subscribers receive the current state immediately (synchronously),
 *    so React hooks don't need a separate "getState" call to seed their UI.
 *  - Listener exceptions are caught and logged, never propagated back into
 *    the caller of `set`.
